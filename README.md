This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving aggregate functions and the `GROUP BY` clause.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that is prone to producing unpredictable results due to a missing column in the `GROUP BY` clause.  The `bugSolution.sql` file provides the corrected query that addresses this issue.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering which columns are included in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses when working with aggregate functions in SQL.
